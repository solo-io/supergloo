    in a much more human readable error

  description: >
    Switch the language around the error when cluster register operations fail. Now, if the service account
    or cluster role binding cannot be created, a user friendly error will be printed, followed by the underlying
    error from kubernetes. Most likely a resource exists, or timeout error depending on the situation
