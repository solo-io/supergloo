            A VirtualDestination creates a new hostname to which client workloads can send requests.
               The hostname abstracts over a set of underlying Destinations and provides failover functionality between them.
               Failover order is determined by either an explicitly defined priority (`static`), or a list of locality directives (`localized`).

               Each Destination backing the VirtualDestination must be configured with a
               [TrafficPolicy's outlier detection]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com.solo-io.gloo-mesh.api.networking.v1.traffic_policy/" >}}).
               Currently this feature only supports Destinations backed by Istio.

            VirtualGateway is the top-level object for configuring ingress into a Mesh or VirtualMesh.
               A single VirtualGateway can apply to multiple deployed ingress pods and sidecars across meshes and clusters contained within a VirtualMesh.
               VirtualGateways can route traffic to destination services which live in a specific cluster or mesh.
               This allows VirtualGateways to route traffic from an ingress or sidecar in one mesh to a service in another. In order to
               perform cross-mesh routing, the Gateway Mesh and Destination mesh must be contained in a single VirtualMesh, with federation enabled.

            connectionHandlers:
              description: |-
                Each Gateway must implement one or more ConnectionHandlers.
                A ConnectionHandler instructs the gateway how to handle clients
                which have connected to the specified bind address.
                Typically `connectionHandlers` will consist of a single `http` handler
                which serves HTTP Routes defined in a set of VirtualHosts.
                Multiple `connectionHandlers` can be specified to provide different behavior
                on the same Gateway, e.g. one for TCP and one for HTTP traffic.

            A `VirtualHost` is used to configure routes. It is selected by a `VirtualGateway`, and may be attached
               to more than one gateway. The `VirtualHost` contains the top-level configuration and route options, such
               as domains to match against, and any options to be shared by its routes. Routes can send traffic directly
               to a service, or can delegate to a `RouteTable` to perform further routing decisions.
          properties:
            domains:
              description: |-
                The list of domains (i.e.: matching the `Host` header of a request) that belong to this virtual host.
                Note that the wildcard will not match the empty string. e.g. “*-bar.foo.com” will match “baz-bar.foo.com”
                but not “-bar.foo.com”. Additionally, a special entry “*” is allowed which will match any host/authority header.
                Only a single virtual host on a gateway can match on “*”. A domain must be unique across all
                virtual hosts on a gateway or the config will be invalidated by Gloo
                Domains on virtual hosts obey the same rules as [Envoy Virtual Hosts](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/api/envoy/api/v2/route/route.proto)

                                                      The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.
                                                      The entire request header value must represent an integer in base 10 notation: consisting of
                                                      an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits. The rule will not match if
                                                      the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating

                                                      The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.
                                                      The entire request header value must represent an integer in base 10 notation: consisting of
                                                      an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits. The rule will not match if
                                                      the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating

                                                        The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.

                                                        the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating

            RouteTable is a resource which can be referenced either from the top level VirtualHost resource, or from
               other RouteTables. It's primary use is to organizationally and logically separate the configuration of Routes,
               so that the responsibilities of Route configuration and maintenance can be divided between teams where appropriate.

                      Matchers contain parameters for matching requests (i.e., based on HTTP path, headers, etc.).
                      If empty, the route will match all requests (i.e, a single "/" path prefix matcher).
                      For delegated routes, any parent matcher must have a `prefix` path matcher.

                                                        The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.

                                                        the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating

                                                        request header value matches the regex. The regex grammar used in the value field is defined

                                                        If specified, header match will be performed based on range.
                                                        The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.
                                                        The entire request header value must represent an integer in base 10 notation: consisting of
                                                        an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits. The rule will not match if
                                                        the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating

            A ServiceDependency specifies explicit dependencies between traffic sources and destinations in a service graph.
               Depending on the underlying service mesh, explicitly describing dependencies can improve the performance
               of the data plane by pruning away any unneeded networking configuration from the relevant proxies.

               The complete set of service dependencies for a given traffic source is the aggregation of all
               unique Destinations selected by any applicable ServiceDependencies. If a traffic source has no applied
               ServiceDependencies, its service dependency configuration defaults to the behavior of the underlying service mesh.

               Note that in order to block communication between sources and destinations not explicitly declared
               in a ServiceDependency, additional configuration on the underlying service mesh may be required.
               For instance, Istio must be configured with `outboundTrafficPolicy.Mode` set to `REGISTRY_ONLY` (see [here](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/#MeshConfig-OutboundTrafficPolicy))
               to enforce this behavior.
