                                                  The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.
                                                  The entire request header value must represent an integer in base 10 notation: consisting of
                                                  an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits. The rule will not match if
                                                  the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating

                                                  Examples:

                                                  If specified, header match will be performed based on range.
                                                  The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.
                                                  The entire request header value must represent an integer in base 10 notation: consisting of
                                                  an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits. The rule will not match if
                                                  the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating
                                                  point numbers or if only a subsequence of the header value is an integer.

                                                  Examples:

                                                  * For range [-10,0), route will match for header value -1, but not for 0, "somestring", 10.9,
