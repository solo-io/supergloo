            Describes a collection of access logs sourced from a set of workloads and optionally
               filtered based on request criteria.

            filters:
              description: |-
                Configure criteria for determining which access logs will be collected.
                The list is disjunctive, a request will be collected if it matches any filter.
                Leave empty to emit all access logs.

                          If set to true, the result of the match will be inverted. Defaults to false.

                                 * name=foo, value=bar, invert_match=true: matches if no header named `foo` with value `bar` is present
                                 * name=foo, value=``\d{3}``, regex=true, invert_match=true: matches if no header named `foo` with a value consisting of three integers is present
