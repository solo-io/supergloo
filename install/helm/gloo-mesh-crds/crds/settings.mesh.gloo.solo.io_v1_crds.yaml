                            If a key is not in the cache, fetch the most recent keys from
                            the IdP and update the cache. This value sets the number of
                            requests to the IdP per polling interval. If that limit is
                            exceeded, we will stop fetching from the IdP for the
                            remainder of the polling interval.

                            default policy since we assume that IdPs publish keys before
                            they rotate them, and frequent polling finds the newest keys.
