            IssuedCertificates are used to issue SSL certificates
               to remote Kubernetes clusters from a central (out-of-cluster) Certificate Authority.

               When an IssuedCertificate is created, a certificate is issued to a remote cluster by a central Certificate Authority via
               the following workflow:

               1. The Certificate Issuer creates the IssuedCertificate resource on the remote cluster
               2. The Certificate Signature Requesting Agent installed to the remote cluster generates
                 a Certificate Signing Request and writes it to the status of the IssuedCertificate
               3. Finally, the Certificate Issuer generates signed a certificate for the CSR and writes
                 it back as Kubernetes Secret in the remote cluster.

               Trust can therefore be established across clusters without requiring
               private keys to ever leave the node.

            CertificateRequests are generated by the Gloo Mesh agent installed on managed clusters.
               They are used to request a signed certificate from the certificate issuer (the Gloo Mesh server) based on a private key
               generated by the agent (which never leaves the managed cluster).

               When Gloo Mesh creates an IssuedCertificate on a managed cluster, the local Gloo Mesh Agent
               will generate a CertificateRequest corresponding to it.

               Gloo Mesh will then process the certificate signing request contained in the
               `CertificateRequestSpec` and write the signed SSL certificate back as a Kubernetes secret in the managed cluster,
               and update the `CertificateRequestStatus` to point to that secret.

            When certificates are issued, Istio-controlled pods need to be bounced (restarted) to ensure they pick up the
               new certificates due to [this issue](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/22993).
               The certificate issuer will create a PodBounceDirective containing the namespaces and labels
               of the pods that need to be bounced in order to pick up the new certs.

                which share a data plane with the target mesh.
