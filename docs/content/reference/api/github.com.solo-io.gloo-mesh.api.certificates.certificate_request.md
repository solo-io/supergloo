### CertificateRequestSpec
CertificateRequests are generated by the Gloo Mesh agent installed on managed clusters. They are used to request a signed certificate from the certificate issuer (the Gloo Mesh server) based on a private key generated by the agent (which never leaves the managed cluster).<br>When Gloo Mesh creates an IssuedCertificate on a managed cluster, the local Gloo Mesh Agent will generate a CertificateRequest corresponding to it.<br>Gloo Mesh will then process the certificate signing request contained in the `CertificateRequestSpec` and write the signed SSL certificate back as a Kubernetes secret in the managed cluster, and update the `CertificateRequestStatus` to point to that secret.


| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| certificateSigningRequest | bytes |  | Base64-encoded data for the PKCS#10 Certificate Signing Request issued by the Gloo Mesh agent deployed in the managed cluster, corresponding to the IssuedRequest received by the Gloo Mesh agent. |
