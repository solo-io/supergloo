### CertificateRequestSpec
CertificateRequests are generated by the CertificateRequesting Agent installed on managed clusters. They are used to request a signed certificate from Gloo Mesh based on a private key generated by the Agent (which never leaves the managed cluster).<br>When Gloo Mesh creates an IssuedCertificate on a managed cluster, the local CertificateRequesting Agent will generate a CertificateRequest corresponding to it.<br>Gloo Mesh will then process the Certificate Signing Request contained in the CertificateRequestSpec and write the signed SSL certificate back as a secret in the managed cluster, and update the CertificateRequest Status to point to that secret.

| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| certificateSigningRequest | bytes |  | Base64-encoded data for the PKCS#10 Certificate Signing Request issued by the CertificateRequesting Agent deployed in the managed cluster, corresponding to the IssuedRequest received by the CertificateRequesting Agent. |
